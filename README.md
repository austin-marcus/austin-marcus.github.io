I am currently a graduate student at Binghamton University pursuing an MS in
Systems Science. I am working under Dr. Hiroki Sayama and Dr. Luis Rocha. 


# Research Interests

I am generally interested in *dynamics* of any kind, and I like to think about
how things change and how there is *structure* in how things change. Thus, I am
studying *complex systems* in general in my current degree program, and am
particularly interested in thermodynamics & statistical mechanics, information
theory, differential equations, and relevant computational modeling techniques.

For more detail, please take a look at my [CV](files/CV.pdf), or send me an email at
amarcus6@binghamton.edu.
